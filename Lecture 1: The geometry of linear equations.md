## The Problem

> fundamental problem of linear algebra : solve a system of linear equations

- **start with a case when we have n linear equations, n unknowns (normal, nice case)**

## The Matrix

#### example

3. **Column picture** : the picture of one column at a time
   - finding right **linear combination**(multiply some number and add...) of columns
